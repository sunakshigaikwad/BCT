# Program: Perform Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division of two numbers

# Accept two numbers from user
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Perform arithmetic operations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2

# To avoid division by zero error
if num2 != 0:
    division = num1 / num2
else:
    division = "Undefined (Cannot divide by zero)"

# Display results
print("\n---- Results ----")
print(f"Addition       : {addition}")
